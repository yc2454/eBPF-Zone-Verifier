//! Proof-guided abstraction refinement subsystem.
//!
//! Distinct from `crate::pcc` (whole-program proof-carrying code): this module
//! produces small per-site SMT proofs that refine the verifier's abstraction,
//! using BCF's binary format and cvc5 as the solver.
//!
//! Algorithmic reference: see the memory file
//! `reference_bcf_symbolic_tracking.md` (distilled from BCF kernel patches
//! set1 + set2 in `/Users/yalucai/BCF/patches-kernel/`).
