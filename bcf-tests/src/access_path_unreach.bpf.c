 * Synthetic repro for the BCF set6 `detect_conflict_eq` port
 * (project_future_improvements.md §0).
 *
 * Pattern: along the fall-through of the *second* branch, path_conds
 * accumulate `r1 != 6` (from the first branch's not-taken edge) and then
 * `r1 == 6` (this branch's not-taken edge). That reversed-opcode pair on
 * the same `reg eq/neq const` is a syntactic contradiction. zovia's
 * interval/zone domain can't represent the `r1 != 6` disequality, so it
 * does NOT report the path inconsistent and would walk into the
 * type-collapsed `r4` load.
 *
 * Faithful to BCF set6: the conflict is detected at the SECOND BRANCH
 * (record_branch_path_conds), not at the load. The path is dropped via
 * the existing per-side drop (analog of the kernel's
 * `goto process_bpf_exit`). NO cvc5 call, NO UNREACHABLE bundle entry —
 * the target kernel's detect_conflict_eq recognizes it natively.
 *
 * Expected: PASS, the unsafe `r4` load is never reached, zero bundle
 * entries, zero solver invocations.
