/*
 * BCF canonical hash — C reference implementation.
 *
 * Specification: docs/userspace-bcf/canonical-hash-spec.md
 * Rust reference: src/refinement/canonical_hash.rs
 *
 * Property: for two BCF expressions a, b in their respective tables,
 *   bcf_checker.c::__expr_equiv(a, b, from_checker=false, own_args=false)
 *     == 1   ==>   zovia_canonical_hash(a) == zovia_canonical_hash(b)
 *
 * Must produce byte-for-byte identical output to the Rust impl on every
 * input. Cross-impl agreement is enforced by the integration test in
 * src/refinement/canonical_hash.rs (cross_impl_agrees).
